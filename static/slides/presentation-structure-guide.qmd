## The guiding principles

The two most important things to know _before_ you make your presentation are...

1. **Goal:** What do you want your audience to know/do by the end of your talk?
1. **Audience:** Who is your audience? What is the most effective way to communicate your goal to _this_ audience?

. . .

Design every part of your presentation to suit your goal and your audience.

## The parts of a (data) science _story_

. . .

Giving a presentation is _telling a story._

. . .

We can make our presentations more engaging by structuring them with storytelling techniques.

## The parts of a (data) science _story_

## The parts of a (data) science _story_

Now, when we map these story components back onto the more "traditional" components of a science presentation,

. . .

we gain a new understanding of why and how we should structure each section.

- Introduction: [Intro]{.fragment .fade-in}
- Rising action: [Methods]{.fragment .fade-in}
- Crisis: [Results]{.fragment .fade-in}
- Falling action: [Conclusion]{.fragment .fade-in}

## Introduction section

. . .

The goal of this section is to establish the [conflict]{.fragment .strike} [research question.]{.fragment .fade-in}

. . .

The introduction section answers the questions:

- What is your research question?
- Why should the audience care?

## Methods section

. . .

The goal of this section is to establish the [rising action]{.fragment .strike} [additional context needed to interpret the results.]{.fragment .fade-in}

. . .

A secondary goal of this section is to establish your credibility as the expert.

. . .

The methods section answers the questions:

- Where do your results come from?
- How should the audience interpret them?
- Why should the audience believe them?

## Methods section

In a data science talk for a non-expert audience, the methods section answers the questions:

- What are the data about?
- Who collected the data?
- What specific variables were measured? How?
- What does the audience need to know about the data for the results to make sense?

## Results section

. . .

The goal of this section is to explain the [crisis]{.fragment .strike} [takeaway of the data.]{.fragment .fade-in}

. . .

**The results section answers the research question.**

. . .

The results can often follow their own mini-story structure.

## Results section

## Conclusion section

. . .

The goal of this section is to explain the [falling action]{.fragment .strike} [what the takeaway means for the audience.]{.fragment .fade-in}

. . .

The conclusion section answers the questions:

- What should the audience think after the talk is over?
- What should the audience do after the talk is over?

## In conclusion...

. . .

A data science talk accomplishes a _goal_ with an _audience._

. . .

The most effective way to accomplish that goal with your audience is by structuring your talk using _storytelling techniques._
