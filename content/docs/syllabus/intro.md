## Course description

Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are multifaceted and highly personal, but can still be broken down into organizing dimensions that help scientists to structure and make sense of underlying psychological constructs. We can use statistical and graphing tools to break down large datasets of human ratings & responses and discover what psychological dimensions lie underneath them.

In this project course, students will analyze open repositories of psychological stimuli and observer ratings to learn about and replicate canonical results of psychological science. Specifically, students will practice decomposing large numbers of psychological variables into latent dimensions like valence and arousal (underlying emotion) or warmth and competence (underlying social trait inference).

This course aims to introduce students to _**scientific** computing_ through the lens of _psychology research,_ and _inspire excitement about the uses and joys of programming for scientists._

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able toâ€¦

- Read in, clean, and inspect a dataset
- Investigate and describe the scientific concepts necessary to make sense of the dataset
- Generate code to manipulate a dataset or produce a data visualization
- Interpret and critique a data visualization
- Identify and debug commonplace R errors

There are _many_ different ways to analyze data, depending on the data and the research question. This course will focus on common exploratory statistical techniques, particularly _dimension reduction_ and _clustering techniques for multivariate data._

## Course format

This course will consist mainly of interactive code-along lectures, interspersed with solo and group work time on in-class activities and exercises.
