Next week, I am going to be at a conference in North Carolina from Monday-Wednesday, so we will meet on Thursday to start exploring patterns in data using graphs.

Since you have the extra time before next week's class, I encourage you to read **[Chapter 2: Getting Started](https://ggplot2-book.org/getting-started) from the ggplot2 textbook.** `ggplot2` is the package we will be using to make our graphs, and it is built on a particular conceptual framework called _the grammar of graphics._ 

I really like the grammar of graphics because it helps us think about what exact data a graph is showing, and how it can be designed to show that data most clearly. We'll talk about it more together, but you can get a head start with the textbook chapter!

While you are not required to work along with the examples and exercises in the chapter, you may find it helpful to work hands-on. You should all have the `ggplot2` package downloaded already because it is part of the tidyverse that we have been using, so as long as you follow the code examples starting from the beginning of the chapter (start with `library(ggplot2)` to enable the functions!), you should not need to download anything else.
