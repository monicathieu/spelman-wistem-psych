## Part 2: Guide to customizing R slides

(Specifically, slides created using .qmd files with reveal.js like we are in this class.)

This shows several examples of putting pictures on slides, changing background colors, etc. You can find much more detailed information about changing slide aesthetics at the [official help page](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/), but it does take a little bit more effort to search for the code you want.
