## Textbook

The primary reference book for this course is [R for Data Science, 2nd edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz), by Wickham, Cetinkaya-Rundel, & Grolemund (2023).

Class sessions, and the examples worked in class and on problem sets, will not strictly follow the textbook in chronological order. There are no "required" readings. Nonetheless, if you like using reference texts to supplement your work, the textbook is an excellent reference for reading more about how and why to use the techniques we practice in class.

### Package documentation & use guides

- [Tidyverse online package documentation](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/): much more detailed and comprehensive
- [Tidyverse cheatsheets](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/): quicker one-stop-shop help, but less detailed
- [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org) by Winston Chang, which uses ggplot2 (which we use)
