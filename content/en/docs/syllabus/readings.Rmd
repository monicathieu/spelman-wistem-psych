## Textbook

The primary reference book for this course is [R for Data Science, 2nd edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz), by Wickham, Cetinkaya-Rundel, & Grolemund (2023).

Class sessions, and the examples worked in class and on problem sets, will not strictly follow the textbook in chronological order. There are no "required" readings. Nonetheless, if you like using reference texts to supplement your work, the textbook is an excellent reference for reading more about how and why to use the techniques we practice in class.

## Additional references

As we use them, this section will be updated with links to useful web pages for help with certain packages, techniques, etc.
